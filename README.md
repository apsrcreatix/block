# block
Block based on card and matrix implemented in Vanilla Javascript

## Idea, Thinking out loud, Pointers

- Block matching game / memory game
- Fast
- Play as you grow, level up automatically
- No framework allowed, Vanilla Javascript only
- We can use cards as face value ["A","K","Q","J","10","9","8","7","6","5","4","3","2"] x ["S","H","D","C"] combination gives 52 cards
- final level level can be 52 x 52
- time user takes to solve
- score
- universal board, members, team etc etc
